      <p class="body"><strong>Background:</strong> I am from a small town in Alaska where I lived until I graduated from highschool, and then continued on to higher education at the <i>University of Alaska, Fairbanks</i> 
        where I studied <i>Mechanical Engineering</i>. I got my first job out of college as a field engineer in the oil & gas industry where I discovered my passion for programming. While 
        working as a field engineer, I was able to experiment with small coding projects such as <i>VBA</i> and <i>Python.</i> Over the next few years I continued doing small projects. 
        Eventually, I wanted to move onto bigger projects but lacked the knowledge required. After many months of debate with myself, I decided to fullfill my dream of becoming 
        a Software Engineer by taking the Flatiron Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Although I am new to the coding community, I believe my organization, passion, and dedication will allow me to be successful during this career change. Please feel free to 
        reach out for any reason, my contact information can be found on the <i>Contact</i> page in the main menu.
